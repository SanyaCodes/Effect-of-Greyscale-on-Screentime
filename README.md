# Effect-of-Greyscale-on-Screentime
About this project:

A high amount of screen time and phone use can have a serious effect on mental health and physical well being. To tackle this issue, our project explores the use of removing colors from mobile phones to reduce overall screen time. This projectâ€™s results show that even with a specific treatment to make phones unappealing to use, there is not a statistically significant change in phone usage after changing the screen filter to greyscale.
